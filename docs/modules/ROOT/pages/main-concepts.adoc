include::./includes/attributes.adoc[]

== How it works

It's really simple, the web bundler:

1. takes/watches your web resources and web dependencies.footnote:[Integrated with NPM dependencies through https://mvnpm.org[mvnpm] or https://www.webjars.org/[webjars]]

2. bundles it with the really fast esbuild compiler (scss are compiled if needed).

3. create a mapping of the bundle public path by entrypoint key.footnote:[By default, it is `main.js` and `main.css`, but it can be configured to have different entrypoint]

NOTE: The bundle mapping is available thought injection in the Java code or in Qute
